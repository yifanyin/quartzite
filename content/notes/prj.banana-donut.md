# Finite-frequency tomography
For my master thesis with [Prof Shu-Huei Hung](http://web.gl.ntu.edu.tw/ENG/index.php/about-us/faculty/professors/item/49-professor-shu-huei-hung), I work with finite-frequency tomography to image the mantle below Basin and Range province, USA.

# Radial anisotropy
Later, as research assistant with [Dr. Fédéric Deschamps](https://www.earth.sinica.edu.tw/member/info/13?lang=en), I invert radial anisotropy using the ambient-noise generated Rayleigh waves.
