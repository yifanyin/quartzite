## How to achieve earthquake forecasts?
Earthquake weather? Earthquake climate? What do we need to do next?
- Physics-based models capable of [data assimilation](notes/data%20assimilation.md)
- good approximation of the physics we want to model
- upscaling?

## Current state-of-the-art forecasting tools
- [ETAS](notes/ETAS.md)
- [Coulomb rate-and-state model](notes/Coulomb%20rate-and-state%20model.md)
- advanced traffic light system

## Other fields to learn from
- Weather and climate models
    - Straight-foreward physics of water vapor and atmosphere convection
    - Sate 
- Induced seismicity in reservoir operations
    - Thermal-hydro-mechenical-chemical models
- Volcano monitoring
    - Lots of different data types like gas, deformation, seismicity. temperature. 
- Building health monitoring
