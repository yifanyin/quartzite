I started to cook, or thinking about cooking, during college. It was not because I finally left home. The college dorm and the shoebox studios for students and singles strongly forbid any kind of cooking. And food was too easy to get around the clock in Taiwan, there was no point of toiling in the kitchen.

I started cooking because I was in the [[notes/Curriculum Vitae#Member and guide of the NCU Hiking club|hiking club]]. And the job of meal planning of multi-day hikes falls naturally on the female team members.
