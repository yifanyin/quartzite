## During your study
### Publish at least one paper
Nowhere is this specified, but every PhD student in ERDW is expected to do it.

### Get 12 credits
Courses took during master degree and those used for qualification do not count! But conference can count as 1 credit. Always ask the student office for advice before it's too late!

### Decide who to be your external examiner
And submit for the department conference to pass. In theory an expert of his/hers area is suffice. But your Prof might favor another Prof.

## Four months before
You'd better start writing already. Meanwhile, search for some templates you like. And remember to make the thesis cover required by ETH.

### Find yourself a chairperson
He/She also needs to handle the thesis report. So find someone responsive.

### Fix the time
This might be the most daunting task. And because the scheduling of five and above is always hard. One might end up with less writing time. Be sure to plan some buffer!

### Fix the paperworks
Details are on the department website.
