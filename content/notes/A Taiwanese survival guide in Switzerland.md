# Food
- The soy milk in Migros is the best soy milk you can get.
- The same applied to Migros' seiden tofu.
- But Coop sells better firm tofu for stir-frys.
- Do not attempt to eat the soymilk yogurt.
- Swiss is famous for its chocolates. But boy you need to try the hot chocolate drink.
- Migros butcher sells fatty pork belly that you can use for *lo-bah* or *khòng-bah*

# Shopping
- Brands from Switzerland: On Running, Mammut, and Rolex (duh)
- Jura bean-to-cup coffee machine

# 食物
- Migros 的豆漿是這裡最好喝的
- 還有他們的嫩豆腐也是。
- 板豆腐的話 Coop 的豆腐最適合，可以煎炒滷。
- 拜託不要吃豆漿做的優格
- 瑞士巧克力有名，熱可可粉更棒。
- Pao Pao Modern Tea 的珍奶可以。
