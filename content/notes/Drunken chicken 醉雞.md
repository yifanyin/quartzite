# Ingredient
- Chicken pieces
	- Some like to use boneless thighs and wrap the meat into rolls.
	- But whole pieces of chickens also works.
- Shaoxingjiu 紹興酒
	- But I use all kinds of alcohol like sake or Kaoliang.
- Goji berry
- Salt

# Preparation
- Cook the chicken pieces in 80-90℃ water until cooked through, meaning the temperature at the center should reach 74℃.
- Cool the chicken pieces in cold water
- Condense the chicken stock. Add other spices or herb in the stock if desired.
- Cool the stock, add equal amount of alcohol.
- Add salt until the stock taste saltier than you would like for soups.
- Put the chicken pieces in and marinate overnight.
